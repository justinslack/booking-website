Hailing from the U.S. of A, Shoemaker has been bringing his love of disco and vinyl to the shores of Cape Town for over six years now.

Shoemaker grew up in a family on the east coast of the United States where music was always the cornerstone of the home. When he left the States over a decade ago, his love for music was only magnified by his travels around the world. 

Shortly after, an obsession for disco music sent him down a path of collecting and playing records when he made Cape Town his new home in 2011. With multiple residencies in the city under his belt over the years, his drive for finding new music and sounds inspires him to consistently dig deeper. 

Today, Shoemakerâ€™s sets are influenced by disco, Latin, African, Zouk, house, and music from all corners of the world - never one to stick to one sound or genre. He aims to spoil listeners with music they are unfamiliar with but find irresistible not to move to!

Shoemaker has played at MCQP, Sexy Groovy Love, Kinky Summer, Rocking the Daisies, Retreat Yourself among other festivals and is a regular DJ in the city bowl where you can catch him playing at various venues around town.
